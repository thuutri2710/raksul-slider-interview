### Changelog

Because I have a full-time job so I just do this assignment for 1-2 hours every every night. It took me 4 day to complete. I try to improve behaviors and test most cases. Hopefully, it makes you satisfied.

### Changelog:

- [9 June] Init source and create components: dots, basic slider, prev button, next button.
- [10 June] Handle animation when click prev button, next button and dots.
- [11 June] Handle drag action and make slider animation smoother.
- [12 June] Responsive for all screen and writing docs. Besides, I migrated CSS without UI framework because I missed the requirement.
